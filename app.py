This is a specification of LUMA interface, which is understood by Oneprovider, and for each storage it is best to implement a specific LUMA implementation.  A stub implementation can be generated automatically from this specification using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) tool in mulitple programming frameworks.  LUMA provides a 2-way mapping interface allowing to:  * Get user credentials for specific storage based on user federated Id  * Get user federated Id (in specific IdP) based on storage credentials  Additionally, LUMA allows for mapping between user groups on a federated (IdP) level and storage, independently of any specific user.  LUMA supports the same storage systems which are supported by Oneprovider, and for each of them a specific must be implemented as typically different storage systems require different types of credentials.  As of now there are the following supported storage systems, each with it&#39;s own type of credentials:  * Posix  * Ceph  * Amazon S3  * Openstack Swift  * GlusterFS  More information: [https://github.com/onedata/luma](https://github.com/onedata/luma) '})
